it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'MySQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n] y
for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for MySQL extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values? [Y/n] n
GET parameters 'order' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] n
do you want sqlmap to try to optimize value(s) for DBMS delay responses (option '--time-sec')? [Y/n] y

it is recommended to perform only basic UNION tests if there is not at least one other (potential) technique found. Do you want to reduce the number of requests? [Y/n] y
